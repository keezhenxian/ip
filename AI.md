# AI.md

This project makes use of AI assistance as part of the **A-AiAssisted increment**.

## Tool Used
- ChatGPT (OpenAI GPT-5)

## How AI Helped

### 1. Code Quality / Style
- Refactored classes to meet [SE-EDU / CS2103T Java coding conventions](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/index.html).
- Improved Javadoc consistency (e.g., `MainApp`, `AddDeadlineCommand`, `AddEventCommand`, `AddTodoCommand`, `DeleteCommand`, `DoneCommand`).
- Suggested cleaner naming and small structural improvements.
- Added inline comments to explain validation logic and execution flow.

### 2. Documentation
- Generated detailed Javadoc for classes and methods.
- Added clarifying in-code comments where needed.
- Produced an improved `AI.md` file (this file) to document AI use.
- Suggested README refinements for clarity.

### 3. Tests
- Provided guidance and generated **JUnit 5 unit tests** for tricky methods and edge cases.
- Ensured tests covered input validation (e.g., blank descriptions, invalid indexes).

### 4. Bug Fixes / Behavior Tweaks
- Explained potential causes of failing tests.
- Proposed fixes for edge cases such as invalid task indexes and blank input handling.
- Helped improve error messages for user clarity.

### 5. GUI Tweaks
- Suggested small UX improvements in the JavaFX GUI:
    - Improved window title text (`Bestbot`).
    - Suggested clearer error messages and potential placeholder text.

## Studentâ€™s Role
- I carefully reviewed all AI-suggested improvements and edited them where necessary to ensure correctness, clarity, and compliance with module requirements.
- All final changes were tested, verified, and integrated into the codebase by me.
