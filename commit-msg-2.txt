[Level-10] Wire GUI to Bestbot backend and Ui overload

Integrate the existing Bestbot backend with the JavaFX UI by
adding Bestbot.getResponse(String) and Ui(PrintStream). Inject
a Bestbot instance into MainWindow after loading FXML so the
GUI can call backend logic without printing to the console.
